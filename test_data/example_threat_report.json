Although many of its claims are unverifiable, we believe that the Izzah Hackers group has successfully conducted numerous low to moderate sophistication attacks, using techniques including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (SQLi). The group has targeted websites affiliated with various other organizations perceived to be anti-Islamic, including the Sri Lankan and Chinese governments. Izzah Hackers loosely affiliates with AnonGhost in support of named Anonymous operations, but it often acts independently. FireEye believes that Izzah Hackers will continue to target government-affiliated and independent entities if these entities receive media attention for behavior perceived as anti-Islamic.</p>",
